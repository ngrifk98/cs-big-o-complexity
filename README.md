# Big-O Complexity Lab Summary

In this lab exercise, I explored various code snippets and functions to analyze their time and space complexity. Here's a summary of the findings for each problem:

## Time Complexity:

1. Problem 1 (printNumbers): O(n)
2. Problem 2 (findFourth): O(n)
3. Problem 3 (printA): O(1)
4. Problem 4 (printB): O(n)
5. Problem 5 (printC): O(num * arr.length)
6. Problem 6 (nested): O(n^2)
7. Problem 7 (filter higher-order function): O(n)
8. Problem 8 (map higher-order function): O(n)
9. Problem 9 (removeNum): O(n)
10. Problem 10 (insertNum): O(n)
11. Problem 11 (pushNum): O(1)
12. Problem 12 (printFirstTwoNames): O(1)

## Space Complexity:

1. Problem 1 (printNumbers): O(1)
2. Problem 2 (findFourth): O(1)
3. Problem 3 (printA): O(1)
4. Problem 4 (printB): O(1)
5. Problem 5 (printC): O(1)
6. Problem 6 (nested): O(1)
7. Problem 7 (filter higher-order function): O(m) (m is the number of filtered elements)
8. Problem 8 (map higher-order function): O(n)
9. Problem 9 (removeNum): O(1)
10. Problem 10 (insertNum): O(n)
11. Problem 11 (pushNum): O(1)
12. Problem 12 (printFirstTwoNames): O(1)
13. Problem 13 (arrInception): O(1)
14. Problem 14 (getNumbersSquared): O(n)
15. Problem 15 (countLetters): O(1)
16. Problem 15 (countLettersRoundTwo): O(k) (k is the number of unique lowercase characters)

Overall, the lab exercise helped me understand how to analyze the time and space complexity of various code snippets and functions, enabling me to make informed decisions about optimizing code for efficiency.
